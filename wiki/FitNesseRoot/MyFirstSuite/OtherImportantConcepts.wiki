!2 Page Types
FitNesse supports three types of page types. A Suite Page, Test Page and Static Page. A few page names are special.

The special page types are:
For FitNesse:
* !-PageFooter-!
* !-PageHeader-!
* !-TemplateLibrary-!

For Testing:
* !-ScenarioLibrary-!
* !-SuiteSetUp-!
* !-SuiteTearDown-!
* !-SetUp-!
* !-TearDown-!

Just remember, if naming a page in a manner as above, it'll immediately serve a special purpose.
