!3 Management summary:
To run Allure reports from Jenkins and save history:

 * create a Jenkins Maven job
 * Run: clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test failsafe:verify -Dfolder= -DfitnesseSuiteToRun=MyFirstSuite.VersionCheck -Pallure
 * Then as post-build step run: site -Pallure
 
If site -Pallure has been run before, an Allure report exists. The history and trends from the previous report will be copied to the new report. If you clear your Jenkins workspace, you'll lose these too.

To run combined FitNesse reports, make sure the FitNesse results are in their own subfolder, add: -DfitnesseResultsDir=target/fitnesse-results/<folder> to your maven command.

Combining Allure and combined FitNesse reports is possible, but requires changes in the pom.xml file.

!2 Running from the commandline (or build server)
!3 Base command

 * ''mvn test-compile failsafe:integrationtest''

test execution can be configured using systemproperties and maven settings:

!4 System properties
 * Set system propertys using the -D flag
 * For example !style_code[-DmyProperty=someValue] or !style_code[-DsomeProperty="value of the property"]

The following properties can be used to configure testing:

|'''Property'''                 |'''Example value'''                                                       |                                                                                                                               |
